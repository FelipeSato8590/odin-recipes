        Use Chef John's "mathematical method" for cooking prime
        rib to achieve a perfectly pink and delicious rib.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the recipe to work make sure to leave the beef out
        at room temperature for a minimum of <strong>6 hours</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients needed</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (4 pound) bone-in prime rib roast at room
            temperature
        </li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon herbes de Provence</li>
        <li>kosher salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps needed</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place prime rib roast on a plate and bring to room temperature, 2 to 4 hours.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>Combine butter, pepper, and herbes de Provence in a bowl; mix until well blended. Spread butter mixture evenly over entire roast. Season roast generously with kosher salt.
        </li>
        <li>Roast the 4-pound roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. (If your roast is larger or smaller than 4 pounds, multiply the exact weight times 5 minutes.)

        </li>
        <li>Turn the oven off and, leaving the roast in the oven with the door closed, let the roast sit in the oven for 2 hours.

        </li>
        <li>Remove roast from the oven, slice, and serve.

        </li>
    </ol>
